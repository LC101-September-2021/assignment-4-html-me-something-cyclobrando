            <h2>Chapter 1: Born Historian</h2>
            <p>
               I was taking pictures long before it was cool. No seriously, long before
               Facebook and Instagram, like George Harrison taking a selfie at the Taj
               Mahal, I was a high-school proto-food blogger photographing pancakes at 
               Denny's. I've always loved taking pictures, since I held that first camera 
               anyway. My high school German teacher had me pegged to be the German Club 
               President, but I was only a sophomore. I had to hold other roles until my 
               senior year, the first of which was Club Historian. I was given a very 
               primitive digital point and shoot camera, and it was a blast.

            <h2>Chapter 2: Ginsburg Moments</h2>
            <p>
               From the start, I was trying to get candid moments amongst my friends. It
               was pretty easy. I had the camera so often that they quickly forgot it was
               there. I wish I had access to a lot of those early moments, but alas, they
               are stuck in the purgatory of an old external hard drive that won't get
               recognized by any computer of mine. Thankfully I saved these classic black
               and whites. We were those kids, buckets of coffee and bursting ash trays at
               2am. These pictures were taken in the world famous HyHo diner. Brain sandwich
               anyone?

            <h2>Chapter 3: Early Among Legends</h2>
            <p>
               As soon as I started producing photos regularly, I sought to get my
               work published in magazines. The first to do so was JPGMag, a
               user-submitted community of photographers and enthusiasts who, alongside
               editors' picks, voted the best pictures into the magazine. My picture was
               pretty decent, a portrait of my elderly grandma holding her birthday
               cake, submitted to the theme <i>Emotion Capture</i>. But that picture on the 
               opposite page, my God. I recognized it right away as a legend, a once
               in a lifetime idea captured perfectly. How could my grandma compete? Well,
               she couldn't. She's dead now. An <abbr title="Non Fungible Token">NFT</abbr>

            <h2>Chapter 4: Working the Camera</h2>
            <p>
               I decide to major in photojournalism, shooting for class and my job at the
               student-run newspaper, hundreds of frames a week. It's so much fun, a new
               "office" every day, courtside seats to basketball games and BB King concerts.
               I love a lot of what I do, but there are some reservations. Am I invading
               people's privacy? Does this work actually improve the world like they
               say... or is that that just smoke the industry blows up it's own ass?

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               College is coming to an end. My interest in photography has never been
               higher. My camera has become my fifth limb as I explore subjects beyond
               the newsroom. I dabble in night photography and produce some new work
               for group shows in Carbondale and Paducah. This picture was exhibited
               at the Yeiser Art Center, a selection of the Paducah Photo International
               Competition and Exhibition.

            <h2>Chapter 6: Cairo Project</h2>
            <p>
               My first year out of college sees me hanging around town. The rent is cheap
               and I have lots of free time to create. Almost immediately I knew I wasn't 
               pursuing a career in journalism. After taking a class on the subject, I'm
               still fascinated with the town of Cairo. I make a lot of work there, exploring
               a style of abstract photography that has become a signature of my style. 
               Work from this series comprised my first ever solo exhibition.

            <h2>Chapter 7: Other Pursuits</h2>
            <p>
               Almost as soon as I found myself on a roll, life intervened. I decided to
               move to Nashville, TN. I thought my photography would continue in the same vein
               as before: explore my environment, let the scenery unveil itself to me. But the
               scenery in Nashville is actually quite ugly and uninspiring when you aren't
               on a disc golf course. My artistic side switched gears, into wine and 
               fermentation, and I became an expert in something else. Photography followed too,
               but it was far less inspired, a lot like Nashville in fact, a bit more 
               corporate and forced.

            <h2>Chapter 8: Selfie-ville</h2>
            <p>
               Like for so many of us in the 2010s, social media was new and exciting. It
               seemed necessary and wonderful, until it was gamified into turning humans
               against each other. During this time, content creation created a vast
               document of our human experience. Every little nuance was photographed
               to a fault. The best angles on everything were found, and yet, today it
               doesn't seem like we've found ourselves in a place as perfect as what appears
               on Instagram. Of course, I made my fair share of selfies during this time.
               My creative drive found an outlet in reinventing myself, a necessary and
               ongoing project in my effort to shed layers of trauma and conditioning.

            <h2>Chapter 9: Like Riding a Bike</h2>
            <p>
               It's been many years removed from the time when I clicked a million frames
               or more, yet I still find myself taking photos, usually with my phone. Covid
               descends like a dark age, and like many others I'm sure, I find a bit of relief
               in acts of nostalgia. I decide to buy a new DSLR camera after nearly 15 years
               since buying my first. The picture quality is so much better! But the core 
               problem of a decade ago remains: what do I actually want to shoot these days?
               I'm still figuring that out. Mainly I'm shooting for myself, my love of nature.
